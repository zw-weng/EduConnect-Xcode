# EduConnect

## Bridging the Educational Gap in Malaysia

EduConnect aims to close the educational divide in Malaysia by offering accessible resources and personalized tutoring to students in underserved rural areas, with a focus on those in Sabah and Sarawak. Designed to support students who face limitations in digital resources and internet connectivity, EduConnect provides quality content, mentorship, and tutoring services to promote educational equity in remote regions. Our vision for EduConnect includes developing an integrated chat feature to facilitate real-time communication between students and mentors/tutors. This enhancement will foster stronger connections and provide immediate support, creating an interactive and supportive learning community.

## Project Setup

To set up the project locally, start by cloning the repository using:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd project-directory
```
Once youâ€™re in the project directory, install the necessary dependencies specified in the `pubspec.yaml` file by running:
```bash
flutter pub get
```
After the dependencies are installed, you can launch the application on an emulator or a connected device with:
```bash
flutter run
```
If you're preparing the app for distribution, you can build a release APK using:
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```
This command creates a production-ready APK file in the `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/` directory.
