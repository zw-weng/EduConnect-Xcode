## Project Description

Our project aims to bridge the educational gap in Malaysia by providing accessible educational resources and personalised tutoring for students in underserved, rural areas. The application focuses on students facing limitations in digital resources and internet access, especially those in Sabah and Sarawak. By delivering quality content, mentorship, and tutoring, we address the pressing need for educational equity in remote regions.
